# Explanatory comment: This code demonstrates the use of the print function with different parameters.

# \r\n -> CRLF: Represents the line break in Windows.
# \n -> LF: Represents the line break in Linux/Mac.

# Example 1: Prints the numbers 12, 34, and 1011
# 'sep' defines the separator between the values (here it is an empty string "")
# 'end' defines what will be added at the end of the line (here it is '#')
print(12, 34, 1011, sep="", end='#')

# Example 2: Prints the numbers 56 and 78
# 'sep' defines the separator between the values (here it is '-')
# 'end' defines what will be added at the end of the line (here it is '\n', which breaks the line)
print(56, 78, sep='-', end='\n')

# Example 3: Prints the numbers 9 and 10
# 'sep' defines the separator between the values (here it is '-')
# 'end' defines what will be added at the end of the line (here it is '\n', which breaks the line)
print(9, 10, sep='-', end='\n')

# Error in the original code:
# The word 'Print' with an uppercase initial is not recognized as a valid function in Python.
# The correct function is 'print' (all in lowercase).
# Fixed by removing or adjusting the line.
